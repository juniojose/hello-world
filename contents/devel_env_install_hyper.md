# Install Hyper Terminal Command

I like use [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) Terminal. To install, [download](https://hyper.is/#installation) the appropriate version and install it normally like any other program for Windows.

Once youâ€™ve got Hyper installed, open the `.hyper.js` configuration file and make one key change. To do this, open Hyper (look at the Windows start bar), click on the sandwich menu (at the top left of the Hyper window [figure 1]), then click **>Edit >Preferences**.

What I want is open `Bash` by default. To do this find the **shell** line and change it to `shell: 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\bash.exe',`.
