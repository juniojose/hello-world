# hello-world by Júnio José

This repository contains systems and applications configuring notes that I use to develop computer programs and others experiences.

## About

At the time of writing this content, I am using an Asus notebook with Windows (currently running version 10).

I don't have the concern to evaluate the compatibility with this or that equipment/system. What's here works on my equipment. Try at your own risk.

## Contents

To install my development environment, I first install [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) on Windows. I follow the steps in this [Microsoft tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

I like [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) Linux Distribution, so I use this command:

| Powershell |
| ------------------------- |
| `wls --install -d Debian` |

At the end of the installation, `wls` will open a shell window asking for the username and password. This password will be used to give you [sudo](https://www.sudo.ws/) access to Linux, so don't forget it.

Once you set the username and password, take the opportunity to update Debian:

| Bash |
| ------------------------- |
| `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade` |
